# NasaApi
Started as a coding assessment for a job, will continue as a labor of love.

### Purpose
Built to access and display images from the NASA API portal at https://api.nasa.gov/.

Since I hope to expand this in the future, to access other NASA APIs, I have de-coupled the architecture, including support for _Dependency Injection_ in the **Program** and **ConsoleApplication** classes.
